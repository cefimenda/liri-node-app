# liri-node-app

LIRI is a simple command line node app that behaves as a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface which takes in parameters and gives you back data.

This is a Columbia Bootcamp Project designed to familiarize students with Node.js and NPM.

Users will need to make sure to run npm install on their CLI to ensure they have all dependencies necessary. 
To use the APIs, users will need to include a .env file that includes relevant API keys. See keys.js to see how the .env file should be structured.
